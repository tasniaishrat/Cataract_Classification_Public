Cataract_Classification_Public
# Developed Mobile Application using Deep learning for Cataract classification. 

# This project presents a mobile application for cataract detection and classification using deep learning techniques. Cataracts are a leading cause of vision loss worldwide, and early detection can significantly reduce the risk of blindness. Our solution leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with transfer learning models to classify eye images as Normal or Cataract.
